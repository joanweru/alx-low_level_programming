# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Statement Syntax

### Variables

To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

`type variableName = value;`

###  If

```
if (condition) {
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### else

```
if (condition)
{
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

## else if

```
if (condition1)
{
	  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}
else
{
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

### while

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

```
while (condition) {
	  // code block to be executed
}
```

## Project Tasks

The following are programs contained in this directory and their uses:

* `0-positive_or_negative.c` - assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
*  `1-last_digit.c` - assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
*  `2-print_alphabet.c` - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
*  `3-print_alphabt.c` - prints the alphabet in lowercase, except q and e, followed by a new line
*  `4-print_alphabets.c` - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
*  `5-print_numbers.c` - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
*  `6-print_numberz.c` -  prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using putchar
*  `7-print_tebahpla.c` - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line
*  `8-print_base16.c` -  prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line
*  `9-print_comb.c` - prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
*  `100-print_comb3.c` - prints all possible different combinations of two digits
*  `101-print_comb4.c` - prints all possible different combinations of three digits
* `102-print_comb5.c` - prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers
